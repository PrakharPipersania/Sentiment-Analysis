Depression is like feeling numb all the time. You’re smiling but it cannot hide the pain. Your whole body feels like a zombie. Too tired but you’re doing your best to survive. It feels like you’re stopping the rain from falling. You want to be dead but afraid to die. Having a lots of hopes and thinking you’re still hopeless.

Being loved but still feels like being alone. A lots of people you know can help you but you don’t have the courage to ask them because you feel like they don’t understand you. It’s like being happy then being sad at the same time.

You can’t understand yourself. You just want to escape from that pain you don’t even know where it from. It’s like everyday is a new life and a new battle you need to survive. A lot of things you want to say but you can’t. It’s like fighting yourself.
